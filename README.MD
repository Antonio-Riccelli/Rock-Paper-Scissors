## A Rock Paper Scissors game in Python

Built to consolidate my understanding of functional programming foundations.

User plays a match against the machine, consisting of four games. The one with the most games wins, otherwise it's a tie.

To spice it up, I've added some pre- and post-match banter between player and computer, in stile of old beat-em-up games, consisting of famous movie lines - this is currently a work in progress and I will expand it further.
